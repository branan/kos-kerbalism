# kOS/Kerbalism Bridge

## Installation/Usage

* Copy `GameData/Kerbalism/Kerbalism112.kbin` to `GameData/Kerbalism/Kerbalism.dll` in your KSP installation.
  * If you know how to make this mod depend lazily on Kerbalism so that the kerbalism loader will work right, please let me know! 
* Copy `GameData/kos_kerbalism` to your KSP installation

You can confirm the mod is installed correctly in kOS with `print ADDONS:AVAILABLE("KERBALISM").`
